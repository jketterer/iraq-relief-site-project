                    <h2>Reimbursing Farmers</h2>
                    <p class="lead">One of ISIS's war strategies was to target Iraqi farms. It was common for them to steal farm equipment while retreating from a territory and destroy what they could not take with them.</p>
                    <p class="lead">ISIS utilized agriculture as a major income source throughout the war. By taking over farms and forcing farmers in captured land to pay tribute, ISIS was able to make agriculture an income source rivalling oil.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Unfortunately, the farmers working in ISIS territories were provided subpar supplies and many had their equipment stolen. We aim to help those farmers who suffered in the war by providing them with necessities to bring their farms back to working status.</p>

                    <h2>Combatting Food Shortages</h2>
                    <p class="lead">During the war, roads were subject to many ISIS raids. These raids interrupted supply routes, and many cities were left without the food and other supplies that citizens required. This resulted in raised prices and mass panic as people attempted to stock up on necessities.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Although the war has ended, many have suffered from the interruption of supplies. Humanitarian relief was unable to reach many cities under ISIS control, and many citizens are still sick and starving. We aim to help those still in need by providing as many supplies to cities formerly under ISIS control.</p>

                    <h2>Relocating Farmers</h2>
                    <p class="lead">During the fighting, ISIS employed a <u>scorched-earth strategy</u>. Essentially, the group would intentionally torch fields and destroy infrastructure when retreating from a lost territory. Intending to limit the ability of the Iraqi government to utilize the land they recaptured, ISIS caused major lasting damage to many of the provinces in northern Iraq.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Farmers who fled the fighting often returned to burned fields, stolen equipment, and slaughtered livestock. For most, this destruction meant an end to their only source of income. We aim to help those who lost land and equipment during the war by helping them relocate to new lands and finance new equipment.</p>
